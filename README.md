# Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering with ML)

## Executive Summary

This project builds a **content-based movie recommendation system** using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. By analyzing metadata like genres, keywords, cast, and director, the model recommends movies that are most similar to a given input.

## Dataset

* **Source:** `movies.csv` (metadata for movies)
* **Key Fields Used:** `genres`, `keywords`, `tagline`, `cast`, `director`
* **Size:** Unknown (CSV not uploaded in repo yet)

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**

   * Loaded movie dataset with Pandas.
   * Selected relevant descriptive features.
   * Handled missing values by replacing nulls with empty strings.
   * Combined all features into a single textual field.

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Applied **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform text into numerical vectors.

3. **Similarity Measurement**

   * Calculated **Cosine Similarity** between movie vectors.
   * Created a similarity matrix to find closest matches.

4. **Recommendation Engine**

   * User inputs a movie name.
   * System finds the closest match using **difflib**.
   * Returns the top N similar movies.

## Key Insights

* Model leverages **metadata-based similarity** (content-based filtering).
* No user ratings required â€” useful where collaborative filtering data is missing.
* Recommendations adapt dynamically to input titles.

##  Skills Highlighted

* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **NLP & Feature Engineering:** TF-IDF Vectorization
* **Machine Learning:** Cosine Similarity for recommendations
* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
* **Interactive Widgets (ipywidgets)** for user input in Jupyter

##  Next Steps

* Add **ratings-based collaborative filtering** for hybrid recommendations.
* Include **popularity-based ranking** for better relevance.
* Deploy model via **Flask/Streamlit app** for user-friendly access.
* Expand dataset to include more recent movies and richer metadata.
